Whether you're drafting a screenplay,
editing a grant,
or co-authoring a manuscript –
the writing process can get messy fast:
tracking changes,
emailing files,
getting feedback,
and comparing versions.
**OddBooks keeps our writing-process uncluttered,
our projects organized,
and our collaborations smooth.**
